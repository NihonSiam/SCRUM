# SCRUM
# Scrum Team Assignment

## Observations
Scrum helped the team work step by step, stay flexible, and keep good communication.  
Everyone always knew what was happening.

## What Went Well & Improvements
**Went well:** Clear roles, teamwork, regular meetings  
**Improvements:** Plan more carefully, make smaller tasks  

## Estimates & Planning
At first, we thought we could do more than possible.  
Later, we learned to make better and smaller estimates.

## Product Owner
The Product Owner gave clear goals and helped the team focus on the most important work.

## What We Learned
We learned that Scrum makes projects easier to manage by splitting big goals into smaller steps.  
It also helps the team stay flexible and improve each sprint.

## Scrum Roles
**Product Owner:** Shares goals and sets priorities  
**Scrum Master:** Supports the team and keeps Scrum running  
**Developers:** Build and deliver the product
