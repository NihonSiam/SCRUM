# Eco-Factory Scrum Project

## Overview
We ran three sprints (4 weeks each) to plan and build an eco-factory concept with community features.  
Regular meetings and a clear backlog kept everyone aligned.

---

## What Went Well
- Maintained a steady sprint rhythm with clear goals and demos.  
- Strong teamwork and smooth handoffs.  
- Team members owned tasks and actively supported each other.  

---

## What We’d Do Differently
- Identify risks and dependencies earlier in the process.  
- Break down user stories into smaller pieces with clear “Definition of Done” checklists before sprint kickoff.  

---

## Estimates & Sprint Planning
- Early estimates were too optimistic.  
- Improved accuracy by breaking work into smaller tasks and re-estimating.  
- By Sprints 2–3, most planned work was completed with minimal carryover.  

---

## Product Owner
**Sajib** ensured priorities were clear and stayed available for questions.  
Acceptance criteria sharpened with each sprint, reducing rework.

## What We Learned About Scrum
Scrum provides a simple, effective structure:
- Plan → Build → Review → Improve  
- Short cycles, small stories, and frequent feedback made progress visible.  
- Enabled fast adjustments and continuous improvement.  

---

## Scrum Roles & Responsibilities
- **Scrum Master (Sadia):** Facilitated ceremonies, removed blockers, and ensured Scrum practices.  
- **Product Owner (Sajib):** Defined vision, ordered backlog, set acceptance criteria, and accepted work.  
- **Developers (Nihon, Tawheed):** Designed, built, tested, integrated, and maintained transparency and quality.

## Key Takeaway
Scrum helped us deliver an evolving eco-factory concept through teamwork, transparency, and iterative improvement.
